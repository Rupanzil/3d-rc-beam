# 3D Interactive Singly Reinforced Beam App

**This is a work in progress**

## Features

- Design of Singly reinforced RCC Beam along with visualization of neutral axis
- The main objective is to show how various parameters which are used to design an RCC Singly Reinforced beam vary and interact with each other.
- Goal is to design both the main and shear reinforcements.
- The purpose of this app is for educational purpose.
- Design will be done using IS 456:2000 for now. Design in other country codes are planned in future.

## Progress Till now

1. Setting up the project.
2. Creation of 3D beam
3. Creation of rebars
4. Setting up proper scaling parameters for ease of use

## To Do List

- [ ] setting up a controller to control the beam dimensions
- [ ] setting up visualization of Neutral axis
- [ ] Setting up visualization of ties
- [ ] setting up the loading part
- [ ] setting up the calculation part of reinforcement
- [ ] will write more when needed
